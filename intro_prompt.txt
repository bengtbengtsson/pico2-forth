I'm working on a minimal Forth interpreter written in C, targeting both macOS (for testing) and the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (RP2040). The code is organized into a shared forth_core.c file with platform-specific entry points for forth_host (macOS) and forth_pico (bare-metal). The project uses CMake to manage dual-target builds and supports unit tests using pytest with a PTY-based wrapper that simulates REPL input.

What's implemented so far:
Phase 1: Stack operations and memory access (+, !, @)

Phase 2: VARIABLE and CONSTANT support with emulated RAM and dictionary

Fully tested using Python + pytest

Tests launch forth_host as a subprocess to ensure isolated stack state

The interpreter uses classic Forth-style uppercase matching for word lookup

Output buffering has been addressed via fflush(stdout) where needed

No runtime memory allocation (except strdup for dictionary names)

No #ifdef between platforms — host and embedded share identical core code

Contribution rules:
Do not alter the project structure or file layout unless explicitly requested or approved.

All proposed changes must be returned as inline patches in the chat (diff-style or full updated file).

I will review and apply changes manually — this ensures I stay in control of the implementation.

Keep responses focused, minimal, and compatible with ANSI C for embedded constraints.

I want help with:
Designing and implementing Phase 3: colon definitions (:, ;), word headers, and runtime threading

Continuing to write portable, testable, and minimal C code

Keeping the interpreter classic and educational (no external libraries, no cheating)

Maintaining testability from macOS without compromising the embedded build
